    <h2 id="abstract">1. Abstract<a name="abstract"></a></h2>
    <p>With the development of large text-to-speech (TTS) models and scale-up of the training data, state-of-the-art TTS
    systems have achieved impressive performance. In this paper, we present <b>WenetSpeech4TTS</b>, a multi-domain
    Mandarin corpus derived from the open-sourced WenetSpeech dataset. Tailored for the text-to-speech tasks, we refined
    WenetSpeech by adjusting segment boundaries, enhancing the audio quality, and eliminating speaker mixing within each
    segment. Following a more accurate transcription process and quality-based data filtering process, the obtained
    WenetSpeech4TTS corpus contains $12,800$ hours of paired audio-text data. Furthermore, we have created subsets of
    varying sizes, categorized by segment quality scores to allow for TTS model training and fine-tuning. VALL-E and
    NaturalSpeech 2 systems are trained and fine-tuned on these subsets, establishing benchmarks for the usability of
    WenetSpeech4TTS and the fair comparison of TTS systems. The corpus and corresponding benchmarks will be made publicly
    available to advance research in this field.</p>

Losing 400,000 taels of military funds was no trivial matter; at the very least, it would be considered a capital offense. Touching his scalp, Fang Qing felt like crying but had no tears left. In his heart, he thought, \"It would have been better if the bandits had shot me dead!\" Sitting dazed by the roadside, he watched as the moon slowly rose to the middle of the sky. After much contemplation, he realized that there was no escaping death. With a sigh, he found a thick rope for tethering horses, tied a knot around his neck, and hung it from a tree branch, attempting suicide. As his body hung in the air and the noose tightened, Fang Qing felt his breath quicken, suffocation setting in, his head pounding with unbearable pain. He thought to himself, \"If I had known hanging myself would be this agonizing, drowning would have been preferable.\" In reality, the cold of early spring in the northern region made drowning equally unbearable. Fang Qing had only sought to end his life out of desperation; deep down, he did not truly want to die. As the noose tightened further and blood rushed, the suffering intensified. Unable to cry out for help, he watched as darkness enveloped him, feeling his life slipping away."] ,

Based on Wei Yang's understanding of the forces among the common people, it's hard to figure out their origins. Being able to swiftly drive away thirty Mo School swordsmen in a moment in the city of Liyang is definitely not something ordinary. Among the schools of thought in the Warring States period, the only one that can compete with the Mo School in clandestine operations is the Guiguzi School. Although other schools have outstanding swordsmen who keep a low profile, they primarily focus on learning and cultivation and are unlikely to carry out such lightning-like storm attacks. Even the military strategists like Yuanshou, whose expertise lies elsewhere, do not engage in covert operations. So, could it be that the Guimen initiated this attack? It's possible. Because the Guiguzi School is staunchly Legalist in political philosophy, they have always opposed the Mo School's intervention in state laws with their indiscriminate \"universal love and non-aggression\" doctrine. Furthermore, the Guimen possess many extraordinary individuals, with masters as skilled as Baili Laoren numbering in the hundreds.

He is dressed in blue cloth, and around his neck, he hangs a silk baby bib embroidered with a picture of flowers, cats, and butterflies, which is already worn and tattered. "This strange man has been sitting here for quite a while. Why doesn't he move?" "Don't call him a strange man. Call him 'elderly uncle.' If you call him a strange man, he'll get angry." "Isn't he strange though? He's so old, yet he's wearing a baby bib around his neck. If he gets angry and his beard sticks up, that would be a sight to see." Taking a lotus seedpod from the small boat, she hurled it toward the man's head. The distance between the small boat and the strange guest was several zhangs (a Chinese measurement unit), and although Lu Wushuang was young, her strength was surprisingly strong, and the throw was quite accurate. "Cousin!" Although they wanted to stop her, it was too late. They saw the lotus seedpod fly straight toward the strange man's face. The strange man tilted his head back and caught the lotus seedpod in his mouth. Instead of reaching for it, he rolled his tongue around it and started chewing on it. The five girls saw that he couldn't peel out the lotus seeds and didn't mind the bitterness, so they started eating the lotus seedpods, petals and all.`],
      ["long2", "洛秩终于长舒了一口气，把目光移向右侧的玻璃，表情放松而冷漠。北京秋天的晚上很有些萧索，烤肉店内外的温差让窗子上结起了密密的水珠。洛秩试探性地拿起了一杯酒，一口灌下。大家都是不被爱的人，自己没那么彪悍勇敢，只能喝酒略表敬意。世界上总有那么一种人，对于庸庸碌碌的普通人来说，他们的存在简直是一种讽刺。比如盛淮南。“对了，你跟他前女友是同班同学吧？”洛秩吓了一跳，本以为对面的人已经睡死了。",`Luozhi finally heaved a sigh of relief, shifting his gaze to the glass on the right with a relaxed yet indifferent expression. Beijing's autumn nights were somewhat desolate, and the temperature difference between inside and outside the barbecue restaurant caused dense beads of water to form on the windows. Luozhi tentatively picked up a glass of wine and gulped it down. Everyone present was unloved, not as fearless and brave as they seemed, but could only drink to show a little respect. In the world, there always exists a kind of person who is an irony to ordinary and mediocre people. For example, Sheng Huainan. "By the way, you and his ex-girlfriend were classmates, right?" Luozhi was startled, thinking the person opposite him had already fallen into a deep sleep.`],
